jrcalendar
==========

This is a simple event calendar built using Emberjs. This calendar application was originally written for a client several years ago as part of a larger application. I decided to rewrite the calendar as a standalone Emberjs application and this is the result.   

This is, so far, very much a work in progress. Don't expect too much of it just yet...
